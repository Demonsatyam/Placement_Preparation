# Backend Preparation – 90 Days Progress Tracker

> **Goal:** Prepare from scratch for Software Developer roles (MAANG / Fortune 500 level) by building strong fundamentals in Core CS, Backend Development, DSA, Systems, and Tooling.

---

## 📅 Day 1 Progress
**Date:** 31-01-2026 (Saturday)  
**Day:** 1 / 90

Day 1 focused on building foundational concepts across multiple subjects while maintaining documentation and revision discipline.

---

## 1️⃣ Computer Networks (1 Hour)

### Topics Covered:
- What is a Computer Network
- General networking terms (basic overview)
- Client–Server model (high-level idea)
- Types of Servers:
  - File Server
  - Web Server
- Types of Networks:
  - LAN (Local Area Network)
  - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  - WAN (Wide Area Network)
- LAN Topologies:
  - Ring Topology
  - Star Topology
  - Bus Topology

### Outcome:
Built a conceptual foundation required for understanding backend systems and distributed applications.

---

## 2️⃣ Development – Backend (1.5 Hours)

### Focus:
**JavaScript Fundamentals for Backend Development**

### Topics Covered:

#### Arrays
- Arrays can store multiple data types (numbers, strings, objects, functions)
- Methods studied:
  - `forEach()` – iteration without returning a new array
  - `map()` – transforms elements and returns a new array
  - `filter()` – selects elements based on condition
  - `find()` – returns the first matching element
  - `indexOf()` – finds index using exact value match

#### Objects
- Object syntax (key–value pairs)
- Accessing properties using dot and bracket notation
- `Object.freeze()` and its use case (preventing mutation)

#### Functions
- `typeof function` returns `"function"`
- Functions are objects internally
- `function.length` returns the number of parameters

#### Async JavaScript (async / await)
- Synchronous code runs line-by-line on the main call stack
- Asynchronous tasks are handled outside the main stack (Node APIs / Web APIs concept)
- Once async work completes, it is queued back and executed after synchronous code finishes

### Outcome:
Gained clarity on JavaScript behavior essential for writing backend logic and handling asynchronous operations.

---

## 3️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

### Focus:
**Pattern Problems**

- Solved multiple pattern-based questions
- Practiced nested loops extensively
- Patterns covered:
  - Square patterns
  - Triangle patterns
  - Floyd’s Triangle
  - Inverted triangle patterns

### Outcome:
Improved logical thinking and control over loops, forming a strong base for further DSA topics.

---

## 4️⃣ System + Linux + Git (30 Minutes)

### Topics Covered:
- What is Git and GitHub
- Purpose of version control systems
- Global Git setup (`user.name`, `user.email`)

### Why this matters:
- Identifies contributors in collaborative projects
- Tracks code changes and history in real-world software development

---

## 5️⃣ Semester Subject (1 Hour)

- ❌ Unable to study semester subject today  
- ⚠️ **Penalty:** Will compensate by studying **2× time on the weekend**

---

## 6️⃣ Revision & Documentation

- Revised all topics studied on Day 1
- Updated progress in `README.md`
- Practiced documentation habits for projects, folders, and learning logs

### Outcome:
Improved retention through revision and developed consistency in documenting work.
